# Junction_2024_Challenge: ThriveConnect
This is a challenge project for Junction Hackathon 2024 - Going Offline. The topic is ThriveConnect: Redefine Work Well-being

## The challenge
Your mission is to create an app where employees can discover job opportunities that align with their personal values, work styles, and mental well-being needs. Both employees and companies will create anonymous profiles, which are matched based on shared priorities like mental health support, flexible working conditions, and workplace culture.

This app will also analyze data on company performance, covering diversity efforts, community engagement, and mental health initiatives, ensuring employees find workplaces that genuinely support their well-being. A key challenge is ensuring transparency and trust—how can we ensure that reviews left on companies are fair and authentic, not biased by HR departments or disgruntled former employees?

The goal behind this app is clear: we want to help companies understand that they can change their structures and culture to become mentally sustainable workplaces. Creating an app that reveals the true atmosphere within a company can apply positive pressure for change, driving businesses to take mental health seriously. We want to lead the conversation on how companies must take responsibility for their employees’ mental health and well-being.

You can leverage various sources to understand which skills and cultural aspects are appreciated in modern workplaces. Let’s connect the dots between company culture and employee competencies.
